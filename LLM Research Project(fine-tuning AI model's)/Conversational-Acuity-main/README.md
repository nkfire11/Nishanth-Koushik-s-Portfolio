# Enhancing LLM Conversational Acuity Using Pragmatic Measures

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the conversational acuity of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating pragmatic measures into their fine-tuning processes. The focus is on improving the contextual accuracy and personalized interaction of LLMs, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, through the integration of linguistic and psychological metrics.

## Features

- **Contextual Accuracy:** Fine-tune LLMs to better capture and emulate user-specific conversational tones, vocabulary, and stylistic nuances.
- **Personalized Interaction:** Use psychological frameworks, such as the Big Five personality traits, to model and mirror user behaviors and traits.
- **Advanced Metrics:** Incorporate tokenization similarity, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and edit distance for evaluating model performance and relevance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Necessary libraries: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `transformers`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhancing-llm-conversational-acuity.git
   cd enhancing-llm-conversational-acuity
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the similarity between text vectors.
- **Jaccard Similarity:** Assesses the overlap between sets of tokens.
- **Edit Distance:** Quantifies the number of edits required to transform one string into another.
