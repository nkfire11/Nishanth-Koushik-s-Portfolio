Hobbes believed in a social contract theory that emphasized the need for a strong central authority to maintain order and prevent the chaos of the state of nature. In his seminal work, Leviathan, Hobbes argued that individuals would voluntarily give up some of their freedom and rights to a sovereign authority in exchange for security and protection. This sovereign authority would have absolute power and serve as the ultimate arbiter of disputes and enforcer of laws.  On the other hand, Rousseau's social contract theory focused on the idea of a collective agreement among individuals to form a community based on shared values and mutual consent. In his work, The Social Contract, Rousseau argued that the social contract should be based on the general will of the people, rather than the will of a sovereign authority. He believed that individuals should come together to create a society that promotes the common good and equality for all members.  Overall, Hobbes' social contract theory emphasizes the need for a strong central authority to maintain order and security, while Rousseau's social contract theory emphasizes the importance of collective decision-making and the common good of the community.\", \"1.

        "    \"The main principles of quantum mechanics as introduced by Niels Bohr are the quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty principle. Bohr’s model of the atom, proposed in 1913, incorporated these principles and laid the foundation for quantum theory. This model postulated that electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels, or shells, and that they can only move between these levels by absorbing or emitting photons. This quantization of energy explained the spectral lines observed in the hydrogen atom, providing a better understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of matter at the subatomic level. Furthermore, Bohr’s model also supported the wave-particle duality of matter, suggesting that particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This idea was later expanded by de Broglie’s hypothesis, which stated that all particles have wave properties and can be described by a wave function. Lastly, Bohr’s work on the uncertainty principle, developed with Heisenberg in 1927, showed that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. This principle highlights the inherent limitations of classical physics when applied to quantum systems and underscores the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. By incorporating these principles, Bohr’s contributions to quantum theory revolutionized our understanding of the atomic world and paved the way for future developments in physics.\",\n",

To evaluate its results, a lower Levenshtein distance indicates greater similarity between the two strings, with a distance of 0 meaning the strings are identical.
