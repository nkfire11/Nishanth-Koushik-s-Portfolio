This process can be divided into two main stages:\\nLight-dependent Reactions: Chlorophyll, a green pigment in the chloroplasts of plant cells, first absorbs light energy. The absorbed light energy then splits water molecules into protons (H+) and electrons (e-) with oxygen (02) as a byproduct. The electrons will travel through a series of proteins known as the electron transport chain, and their energy moves the protons. This creates a proton gradient which drives the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). \\nLight-independent Reactions: The ATP energy and NADPH produced earlier is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, which can be used by the plant. \\nThe overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2.\\n\"}]}\n"
